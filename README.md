# 🧪 Business Research Project: University Cafeteria Satisfaction Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project investigates the impact of **food quality** and **hygiene standards** on student satisfaction in university cafeterias. Using survey data from 115 students, we applied statistical modeling and data visualization to uncover actionable insights for campus service improvement.

## 🎯 Research Question
**How do food quality and hygiene affect student satisfaction in university cafeterias?**

## 📊 Methodology
- **Survey Design**: Structured questionnaire distributed via email and WhatsApp
- **Sample Size**: 115 students across multiple years of study
- **Analysis Techniques**:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Chi-square tests
  - OLS regression modeling
  - Correlation heatmap visualization

## 🧠 Key Findings
- **Food Quality**: Strong positive correlation with satisfaction (p-value ≈ 0.00035)
- **Hygiene**: Statistically significant predictor of satisfaction (p-value = 0.000)
- **Moderating Effect**: Year of study moderates hygiene’s impact, but not food quality
- **Usage Frequency**: 60% of students use the cafeteria daily, reinforcing the need for consistent quality
