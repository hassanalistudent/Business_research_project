#  Business Research Project: University Cafeteria Satisfaction Analysis

##  Overview
This project investigates the impact of **food quality** and **hygiene standards** on student satisfaction in university cafeterias. Using survey data from 115 students, we applied statistical modeling and data visualization to uncover actionable insights for campus service improvement.

##  Research Question
**How do food quality and hygiene affect student satisfaction in university cafeterias?**

##  Methodology
- **Survey Design**: Structured questionnaire distributed via email and WhatsApp
- **Sample Size**: 115 students across multiple years of study
- **Analysis Techniques**:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Chi-square tests
  - OLS regression modeling
  - Correlation heatmap visualization

##  Key Findings
- **Food Quality**: Strong positive correlation with satisfaction (p-value ≈ 0.00035)
- **Hygiene**: Statistically significant predictor of satisfaction (p-value = 0.000)
- **Moderating Effect**: Year of study moderates hygiene’s impact, but not food quality
- **Usage Frequency**: 60% of students use the cafeteria daily, reinforcing the need for consistent quality

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/hassanalistudent/Business_research_project.git`
2. Install dependencies  
   `pip install pandas statsmodels seaborn matplotlib`

##  Conclusion:
- Both food quality and hygiene have a statistically significant and positive impact on student satisfaction.
- Food Quality is the strongest predictor, with a regression coefficient of 0.7608 and a highly significant p-value of 0.002.
- Hygiene also contributes meaningfully, with a coefficient of 0.6213 and p-value of 0.015.
- The OLS model explains 17.2% of the variation in satisfaction (R² = 0.172), confirming that these two factors are important but not the only drivers.
- Year of study moderates the effect of hygiene, suggesting that senior students may be more sensitive to cleanliness standards.

##  Business Implication:

- To improve student satisfaction, university cafeterias should prioritize:
- Enhancing food freshness, taste, and variety
- Maintaining consistent hygiene protocols
- Tailoring hygiene improvements to meet expectations across different student years

##  Recommendations
- Improve food freshness and variety
- Enforce stricter hygiene protocols
- Streamline service during peak hours
- Establish feedback channels for students
