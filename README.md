# Business Research Project: Data Analysis and Visualization

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores business-related survey data to uncover insights using statistical modeling and data visualization. The analysis includes an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to evaluate key predictors of satisfaction, and a correlation heatmap to examine relationships among variables.

## 📁 Files Included
- `report_data.xlsx`: Raw survey data used for analysis.
- `ols_model.py`: Python script for building and summarizing the OLS regression model.
- `correlation_heatmap.py`: Python script for generating a customized correlation heatmap using seaborn and matplotlib.

## 🧪 Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and prepared interaction terms.
- **OLS Regression**: Modeled satisfaction as a function of food and hygiene quality over time.
- **Visualization**: Created a heatmap to highlight variable correlations using a custom color palette.

## 📌 Key Libraries
- `pandas`
- `statsmodels`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

## 📈 Insights
- Identified statistically significant predictors of satisfaction.
- Visualized multicollinearity and variable relationships to guide interpretation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas statsmodels seaborn matplotlib
